This is just a fun project I decided to do to see if I could speed up
my own reading speeds. I read somewhere that most of your time reading
is spent moving your eye from word to word, so I made a program that
reads in a text file and pushing it word-for-word in one central location.

You can see some examples in the bin/ directory. Essentially, you just call
the jar file and pass it an argument with the location of a text file.

This is a prototype. I intend to add a lot of different functionality and
expand the Swing UI to allow for loading text files through the interface
as well as changing speed on the fly.
